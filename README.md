Sielo is a web browser that I began to develop a year and a half ago. The browser has experienced 2 remakes and the last was released few months ago. This time Sielo has been thought with a more stable structure, easier to sustain so a rework is no longer needed.

### Compile the browser
To build Sielo, [check the Wiki](https://github.com/SieloBrowser/SieloBrowser/wiki/%5BEN%5D-Build-Sielo)

## Generalities, advancement and originality
Sielo has well grown. It has all the basic functionalities of a web browser (tabbed browsing, bookmark, history, private browsing, web browsing (yes it is possible), etc.) and even some advanced features such as an integrated AdBlock, proxy management, cache management, ability to save passwords (and encrypt them with a super password). Sielo uses the web engine WebEngine that comes with Qt. But that's not all, Sielo has also unique and original features:
### Tabs space
This is the feature that makes Sielo so special. Tabs spaces allow you to divide your Sielo window into several spaces, as if you had several windows next to each other but interacting with each other. You can resize Tabs spaces, hide them,  mute them... This allow you, among other things, to have several sessions, for example a session called "social networks", an other called "music" and an other called "work". Therefore you can hide the "music" tabs space and retrieve it at any time.

### The floating button
This is another feature specific to Sielo.. This button can be moved everywhere in the browser to give you access to the main controls as easily as possible. It can also be transformed into a lateral toolbar.

### Themes, for an unlimited personalization power
Sielo also supports themes to completely customize the interface. This goes from the floating button to the tabs, via icons. I'm currently writing a little tutorial to learn how to make themes for Sielo. This is not very complicated, just place the icons, list them in a file "theme.index" and do some CSS to customize some objects such as tabs. If the developer wants, the themes can behave differently depending on the operating system, and can be adapted with user colors

## Objectives
Now that Sielo is built on a stable structure, the goal is to make the user experience even more intuitive! A plugins system is already written, so it just remains to be activate and plugins need to be created. I'm also thinking on compatibility with "web extension".

Sielo is also made with ideas of people like you and testers. This is why I am very attentive to all your remarks and all your ideas. Besides, Sielo also integrates a command system, an idea brought by Rein Frost (I let you try to enter "!easteregg" or "!Witcher [enable/disable]" in the address bar).

Furthermore, Sielo also has a [a page where we gather ideas](https://padlet.com/feldrise/j82miccj6zpb) (this page is quite recent and still a little empty). And finally, [the last open beta](https://sielo.app/download.php?for=windows) is free to download! If you use Linux, you can find an AppImage [here](https://sielo.app/download.php?for=linux) and if you use ArchLinux, Sielo is available in the AUR.

I also warmly thanks **hotaru70o**, **LavaPower** ([https://github.com/LavaPower](https://github.com/LavaPower)), **Kaktus** and **ilearn32** for their unfailing support and their contributions, they make this open beta possible! A big thanks to them!
